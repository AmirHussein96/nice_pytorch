Nonlinear Independent Components Estimation
===========================================

An implementation of the NICE model from Dinh et al (2014) in PyTorch.

I was only able to find [the original theano-based repo](https://github.com/laurent-dinh/nice) from the first author,
and I figured it would be good practice to re-implement the architecture in Torch.

Please cite the paper by the original authors and credit them (not me or this repo) if any of the code in this repo
ends up being useful to you in a publication:
